I believe in student-centered teaching. 

### Teaching at Bucknell

**CSCI 187:** Creative Computing and Society
: A course created by [Darakhshan Mir](http://eg.bucknell.edu/~djm056/), CSCI 187 introduces computing in the context of creativity and examining problems of social good. Students create visual artifacts (using the javascript library [p5js](https://p5js.org/)) that will empower them to investigate, and draw novel insights from, data that may be social, historical, or textual in nature. Supplemented with discussions on computing's impact on society.

**CSCI 201:** Computer Science Seminar
: Added to our CSCI curriculum for the first time in Fall 2019, I designed and taught the first iteration of this course, which emphasizes 

**CSCI 203:** Introduction to Computer Science
: In Fall 2019, I redesigned our introductory CS course from the ground up - writing 10+ labs, ~50 applied homework problems (and automated feedback), and multiple projects. Currently, 20-25% of all Bucknell students take this course before graduation. The responsible computing labs that I developed for this course publicly available and used by a number of institutions across the country. 

**CSCI 204:** Data Structures & Algorithms
: Definition 1

**CSCI 205:** Software Engineering & Design
: Originally created by Brian King, we run a flipped-classroom software engineering course, in which students learn Java, OOP design patterns, git, agile/scrum processes, and culminate by building 

**CSCI 358:** Human-Computer Interaction
: I designed and teach Bucknell's 300-level CS elective introducing students to the design processes and technical breadth of Human-Computer Interaction. My course  Rather than lean on a single semester-long design project, I redesigned the traditional HCI course to . This structure is now used by a handful of universities in the USA. 

**CSCI 479:** Computer Science Design Project
: The capstone course for our BA and BS students attaining degrees through the College of Arts & Sciences. In this course, I teach technical writing and communication, instruct on project management, and guide students through system-building decisions to deliver a technical application to local or external clients.
