**Notice:** This page is **heavily** under construction, so stick with me while I work on it. Until then, visit my current homepage at [http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)

This page contains my peer-reviewed scholarship. However, since my work often extends beyond publications, I'd encourage you to visit my project pages to see my activity (both published and unpublished) on the topics I care most about: [Integrating Social Resonsibility into Core CS](/projects/responsibleCS), [Emplowering People through Data](/projects/publicVis), or [Advocating for Undergraduate Research & Institutions](/projects/undergrad)
