This page contains my peer-reviewed scholarship. However, since my work often extends beyond publications, I'd encourage you to visit my project pages to see my activity (both published and unpublished) on the topics I care most about: 
- [Integrating Social Responsibility into Core CS](/projects/responsibleCS)
- [Empowering People through Data](/projects/publicVis), 
- [Advocating for Undergraduate Research & Institutions](/projects/undergrad)
