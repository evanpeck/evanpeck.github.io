<!-- This page contains all of my academic peer-reviewed work. If you're interested in a broader definition of external impact (_e.g._ resources I've developed or articles I've written), I'd _strongly_ encourage you to visit my project pages. They consolidate my work - both published and unpublished - into the topics I care most about: 
- Empowering more people to trust, understand, and engage with public data
- [Teaching more critical, responsible computing practices within core CS curriculum](/projects/responsibleCS), and Undergraduate  blah blah blah
- Centering undergraduate students in our teaching and research practices. -->
