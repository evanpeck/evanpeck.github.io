## Peer-Reviewed Work

This page contains my peer-reviewed scholarship. Since my work often extends beyond publications, I'd _strongly_ encourage you to visit my project pages: (1) [**Integrating Social Responsibility into Core CS**](/projects/responsibleCS), (2) [**Empowering People through Data**](/projects/publicVis), and (3) [**Advocating for Undergraduate Research & Institutions**](/projects/undergrad)
