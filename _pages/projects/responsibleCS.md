## Integrating Social Responsibility into Core CS

**I believe that social responsibility should be integrated in _core_ technical CS curriculum**, and not just relegated to standalone ethics courses. My work has focused on creating [ethical reflection assignments that are tightly coupled with technical programming goals (in CS 1)](https://ethicalcs.github.io/), and I've been fortunate to share these assignments with instructors in secondary ed and higher-ed classrooms across the country.  

I also believe that there is a fundamental limit on the impact of modules without reorienting our _entire_ CS curriculum - equipping students with the necessary cultural background to meaningfully engage with the sociotechnical nature of their products. We should pay closer attention [Nicki Washington's work on Cultural Competency in Computing](https://identity.cs.duke.edu/), and consider how to reprioritize the role of social sciences and humanities within CS core curriculum. Below, see my activity in this space - both at Bucknell and beyond.
