{: .notice--danger}

I am an Associate Professor of [Computer Science at Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/majors-departments/computer-science), having received my [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/) from Tufts University. During my sabbatical, I am working as a Visiting Scientist at [MIT](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/) with [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com/). My research draws on the fields of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-computer-interaction-brief-intro) and [Information Visualization](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/information-visualization). I believe in _student-centered everything_. 

**Fall 2022:** I will be returning from sabbatical and teaching 1 section of [CSCI 358: Human-Computer Interaction](https://sites.google.com/bucknell.edu/csci358hci/home) (TR 1-2:20pm) and 2 sections of [CSCI 479: Computer Science Design Project](https://coursecatalog.bucknell.edu/search/?P=CSCI%20479) (MWF 1-1:50pm and 2-2:50pm)

- **July:** I am helping pilot a new workshop at Bucknell - [_Aspiring PUI Faculty Workshop_](https://bit.ly/bucknell-pui). This October, we'll host late-stage PhD students and post docs at Bucknell in order to help expose them to and prepare them for faculty positions at primarily-undergaduate instituions (PUIs). [Consider applying here!](https://bit.ly/bucknell-pui)
- **July:** üì£ A new year and a new design for [https://cs-pui.github.io/](https://cs-pui.github.io/). CS-PUI is a website that I created to help advertise CS faculty positions at primarily-undergraduate institutions (PUIs) - it's now live for the 2022-2023 hiring cycle! We crossed 10,000 hits last year, and I'm excited to see it continue to grow this year!
- **June:** I joined the [BELIV 2022](https://beliv-workshop.github.io/comittee.html) program committee. This year's workshop focuses on _Designing and Evaluating Visualizations for an Ethical, Inclusive, and Responsible Future_
-   **May:** I co-authored a book chapter with Iris Howley and Darakhshan
    Mir for [The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Education: Practices, Challenges, and Debates](https://www.routledge.com/The-Ethics-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Education-Practices-Challenges/Holmes-Porayska-Pomsta/p/book/9780367349721) by Routledge - *Integrating AI Ethics
    Across the Computing Curriculum*. It\'s now off to the presses! 
-   **May:** Our Bucknell learning community proposal - _STEM (In)Justice: Inside and Outside the Curriculum_ - was approved for 2022-23. I am co-facilitating bi-weekly meetings with Deepak Iyer (Physics + Astronomy), Amal Kabalan (Electrical + Comp Eng), Elif Miskioƒülu (Chem Eng), Darakhshan Mir (CS), and Deborah Sills (Civil Eng) to critically examine STEM's courses, curricula, practices, and pedagogy. 
-   **May:** My internal proposal with Eddy L√≥pez (Art + Art History) was funded for Fall 2022 - _Parallel Courses for Interdisciplinary Engagement_. The grant will support engineering/art speakers + collaborations between my Human-Computer Interaction course and Eddy's Graphic Design course. 
- **April:** Our workshop on [Visualization for Social Good](https://vis4good.github.io/) was accepted to [IEEE VIS 2022](http://ieeevis.org/year/2022/welcome) with a theme of _pedagogy, processs, and protest_. This year, I'll be stepping back from the organizing committee to a steering committee.

- **April:** A successful submission to IEEE VIS + plenty of papers to review. 
- **March:** Congratulations to my wonderful undergraduate researchers - past and present! Sami Wurm ('22) decided she will attend Stanford's _Music, Science, and Tech_ Masters program next year. Reva Sharma's ('25) successful [_Program for Undergraduate Research_](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/undergraduate-research-opportunities/program-undergraduate-research) proposal and Jaehoon Pyon's ('23) successful _Costa Healthcare Research and Design Fund_ proposal means they will both work with me for summer research at Bucknell this year!
- **March:** My [EngageCSEedu](https://www.engage-csedu.org/) paper - _1-Hour Collaborative Learning Activity for Responsible Human-AI Design_ - was presented at a special session at [SIGCSE 2022](https://sigcse2022.sigcse.org/). [See the talk here](https://youtu.be/etKzRgoIahY)
