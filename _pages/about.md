**!!!** Note: This page is **heavily** under construction, so stick with me while I work on it. Until then, visit my current homepage at [http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)
{: .notice}

I am an Associate Professor of [Computer Science at Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/majors-departments/computer-science). I am currently on sabbatical until August 2022, working as a Visiting Scientist at [MIT's Visualization Group](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/) with [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com/). My research draws on the fields of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-computer-interaction-brief-intro) and [Information Visualization](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/information-visualization). I believe in _student-centered everything_

- My research considers the ways in which we are failing to communicate data that serves the public good, and how we can empower more diverse communities through data. I am a co-organizer of [Visualization for Social Good](https://vis4good.github.io/) and my work on [data visualization in rural Pennsylvania](https://medium.com/multiple-views-visualization-research-explained/data-is-personal-what-we-learned-from-42-interviews-in-rural-america-93539f25836d) has been covered extensively in [articles](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/05/31/data-is-personal-and-the-maturing-of-the-literature-on-statistical-graphics/) and [podcasts](https://datastori.es/data-is-personal-with-evan-peck/).
- I believe that ethics should be integrated in technical CS classes. I maintain [a website for practice-based responsible CS activities](https://ethicalcs.github.io/), served as a judge for the Mozilla\'s [Responsible CS Challenge](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/initiatives/responsible-cs/), and have co-organized both workshops and special sections on ethical CS education at [ACM SIGCSE](https://sigcse2019.sigcse.org/).
- I am an advocate for primarily-undergraduate institutions (PUI). I manage [an email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hciforpui) of HCI professors at PUIs, curate [a website for faculty CS positions at PUIs](https://cs-pui.github.io/), and [write](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422) about the [benefits of liberal arts colleges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8490181).
- I see research as a mechanism that should empowers students, and adhere to a [Student-Centered Research Manifesto](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/a-student-centered-research-manifesto-bfb41072fdca). I [publish](http://www.bucknell.edu/news-and-media/current-news/2017/june/student-researchers-ask-how-secure-we-feel-about-internet-security.html) along undergraduate students (including a [Best Paper Award](https://twitter.com/EvanMPeck/status/1107677854970585088) at [ACM CHI](https://chi2019.acm.org/)!), and serve on the selection committee for [CRA\'s Oustanding Undergraduate Researchers award](https://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/).

### What's new

<div markdown="1" class="news">

-   **May:** I co-authored a book chapter with Iris Howley and Darakhshan
    Mir for [The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Education: Practices, Challenges, and Debates](https://www.routledge.com/The-Ethics-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Education-Practices-Challenges/Holmes-Porayska-Pomsta/p/book/9780367349721) by Routledge - *Integrating AI Ethics
    Across the Computing Curriculum*. It\'s now off to the presses! 
-   **May:** Our Bucknell learning community proposal - _STEM (In)Justice: Inside and Outside the Curriculum_ - was approved for 2022-23. I am co-facilitating bi-weekly meetings with Deepak Iyer (Physics + Astronomy), Amal Kabalan (Electrical + Comp Eng), Elif Miskioğlu (Chem Eng), Darakhshan Mir (CS), and Deborah Sills (Civil Eng) to critically examine STEM's courses, curricula, practices, and pedagogy. 
-   **May:** My internal proposal with Eddy López (Art + Art History) was funded for Fall 2022 - _Parallel Courses for Interdisciplinary Engagement_. The grant will support engineering/art speakers + collaborations between my Human-Computer Interaction course and Eddy's Graphic Design course. 
- **April:** I participated in a panel about social and ethical responsibilities in UI - hosted by the UI/UX@MIT student group. 
- **April:** A successful submission to IEEE VIS + plenty of papers to review. 
- **March:** Congratulations to my wonderful undergraduate researchers - past and present! Sami Wurm ('22) decided she will attend Stanford's _Music, Science, and Tech_ Masters program next year. Reva Sharma's ('25) successful [_Program for Undergraduate Research_](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/undergraduate-research-opportunities/program-undergraduate-research) proposal and Jaehoon Pyon's ('23) successful _Costa Healthcare Research and Design Fund_ proposal means they will both work with me for summer research at Bucknell this year!
- **March:** My [EngageCSEedu](https://www.engage-csedu.org/) paper - _1-Hour Collaborative Learning Activity for Responsible Human-AI Design_ - was presented at a special session at [SIGCSE 2022](https://sigcse2022.sigcse.org/). [See the talk here](https://youtu.be/etKzRgoIahY)
