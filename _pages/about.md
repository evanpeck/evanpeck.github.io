# About Me

I am an Associate Professor of [Computer Science at Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/majors-departments/computer-science). I am currently on sabbatical until August 2022, working as a Visiting Scientist at [MIT's Visualization Group](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/) with [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com/). My research draws on the fields of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-computer-interaction-brief-intro) and [Information Visualization](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/information-visualization). I believe in _student-centered everything_

- My research considers ways to empower more diverse communities and people through data tools and representation. I am a co-organizer of Visualization for Social Good and my work on data visualization in rural Pennsylvania has been covered extensively in articles and podcasts.

- I believe that responsibility should be integrated in technical CS classes. I maintain a website for practice-based responsible CS activities, served as a judge for the Mozilla's Responsible CS Challenge, and have co-organized both workshops and special sections on ethical CS education at ACM SIGCSE.

- I am an advocate for primarily-undergraduate institutions (PUI). I manage an email list of HCI professors at PUIs, curate a website for faculty CS positions at PUIs, and write about the benefits of liberal arts colleges.

I see research as a mechanism that should empowers students, and adhere to a Student-Centered Research Manifesto. I publish along undergraduate students (including a Best Paper Award at ACM CHI!), and serve on the selection committee for CRA's Oustanding Undergraduate Researchers award.
