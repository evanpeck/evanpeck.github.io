### About me

I am an Associate Professor of [Computer Science at Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/majors-departments/computer-science), and previously received my [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/) from Tufts University. During my recent sabbatical, I worked as a Visiting Scientist at [MIT](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/) with [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com/). My research draws on the fields of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-computer-interaction-brief-intro) and [Information Visualization](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/information-visualization). I believe in _student-centered everything_. 

**Students:** [Check out my student FAQ](/student-faq) if you have questions about meeting, about research, or about recommendation letters! This semester, I am teaching 1 section of [CSCI 358: Human-Computer Interaction](https://sites.google.com/bucknell.edu/hci-fa22/home) (TR 1-2:20pm) and 2 sections of [CSCI 479: Computer Science Design Project](https://csci479.github.io/) (MWF 1-1:50pm and 2-2:50pm).

- **Dec:** ðŸŽ‰ In collaboration with [Alyx Burns](https://www.alyxburns.com/), [Cindy Xiong](https://cyxiong.com/), [Narges Mahyar](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/nmahyar/), and other wonderful folk at UMass Amherst, our paper _"From Invisible to Visible: Impacts of Metadata in Communicative Data Visualization"_ was accepted to [IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=2945)
- **Dec:** Using an internal grant to support interdisciplinary collaboration, I'm co-organizing a design exhibition and celebration day that spans courses in all 3 colleges at Bucknell - my [Human-Computer Interaction course](https://sites.google.com/bucknell.edu/hci-fa22/home) (in CS through Engineering), Prof. Eddy Lopez's Graphic Design course (in Art through Arts & Sciences), and Prof. Gabriela Diego's Design Realization course (in MIDE through Management)
- **Nov:** I accepted an invitation to be a panelist at the Stanford University's _2023 Embedded EthiCS Conference on Strategies for Teaching Responsible Computing within the Computer Science Curriculum_. More details later!
- **Nov/Dec:** It is reviewing season for the Selection Committee for the [Computing Research Association's (CRA) _Outstanding Undergraduate Researchers_ award](https://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/). It is my 3rd year serving on the committee.
- **Oct:** I co-organized Bucknell's first [_Aspiring PUI Faculty Workshop_](https://bit.ly/bucknell-pui), inviting 7 PhD and post-docs from across the country to reflect on faculty opportunities at undergraduate institutions. We are hoping to expand next year!
- **Oct:** It was wonderful to see the 2nd workshop on [Visualization for Social Good](https://vis4good.github.io/) this year at IEEE Vis. As I've shifted into a steering committee role, the credit really goes to the organizers - Leilani Battle, Michelle Borkin, Emily Wall, Lane Harrison, and Narges Mahyar
- **Sep/Oct/Dec:** Our Bucknell learning community - _STEM (In)Justice: Inside and Outside the Curriculum_ - is holding bi-weekly meetings to critically examine STEM's courses, curricula, practices, and pedagogy. I am co-facilitating with Deepak Iyer (Physics + Astronomy), Amal Kabalan (Electrical + Comp Eng), Elif MiskioÄŸlu (Chem Eng), Darakhshan Mir (CS), and Deborah Sills (Civil Eng) 
- **Sep:** I survived another [ACM CHI submission deadline](https://chi2023.acm.org/), ðŸ¤ž on submitted work. 
- **Sep:** I joined the Steering Commmittee of Bucknell's [Grand Challenges Scholars Program](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/signature-engineering-programs/grand-challenges-scholars-program), which requires students to work on one or more grand societal challenges through a series of high-engagement activities (resaerch, service learning, etc.). 
- **Aug:** For the 2022-23 academic year, I am co-chairing Bucknell University's _Committee on Instruction (COI)_ - Bucknell's governance mechanism for recommending university-wide policies on instructional programs across the university's three colleges.
- **Aug:** I wrapped up a wonderful year-long sabbatical as a Visiting Scientist at MIT with Arvind Satyanarayan and the [MIT Visualization Group](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/). 
- **July:** I am helping pilot a new workshop at Bucknell - [_Aspiring PUI Faculty Workshop_](https://bit.ly/bucknell-pui). This October, we'll host late-stage PhD students and post docs at Bucknell in order to help expose them to and prepare them for faculty positions at primarily-undergaduate instituions (PUIs). [Consider applying here!](https://bit.ly/bucknell-pui)
- **July:** ðŸ“£ A new year and a new design for [https://cs-pui.github.io/](https://cs-pui.github.io/). CS-PUI is a website that I created to help advertise CS faculty positions at primarily-undergraduate institutions (PUIs) - it's now live for the 2022-2023 hiring cycle! We crossed 10,000 hits last year, and I'm excited to see it continue to grow this year!
- **July:** A long overdue redesign of my website is finally complete (this one!): [https://evanpeck.github.io/](https://evanpeck.github.io/). I wrote plenty of custom javascript code to translate JSON publication-info to a prettier website format - feel free to ping me if you're interested in how it works. 
- **June:** I joined the [BELIV 2022](https://beliv-workshop.github.io/comittee.html) program committee. This year's workshop focuses on _Designing and Evaluating Visualizations for an Ethical, Inclusive, and Responsible Future_
-   **May:** I co-authored a book chapter with Iris Howley and Darakhshan
    Mir for [The Ethics of Artificial Intelligence in Education: Practices, Challenges, and Debates](https://www.routledge.com/The-Ethics-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Education-Practices-Challenges/Holmes-Porayska-Pomsta/p/book/9780367349721) by Routledge - *Integrating AI Ethics
    Across the Computing Curriculum*. It\'s now off to the presses!
