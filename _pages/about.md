üì£  I am recruiting PhD students to the _Information Visions Lab_ for Fall 2025 (deadline is  December 1, 2024). If you are interested [you can learn more about our lab and whether you should apply here](https://evanpeck.github.io/group/new-phd).
{: .notice--cu}

I am an Associate Professor of [Information Science at University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience), Associate Chair for Undergraduate Studies, and director of the **CU Information Visions Lab** (_website soon!_).

- üìä [My research group focuses on the opportunities and barriers of public data communication](/projects/publicVis), believing that our engagement, trust, and understanding of data is a critical societal challenge. My work is situated within the fields of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-computer-interaction-brief-intro) and [Information Visualization](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/information-visualization). 
- üßë‚Äçüíª As [an advocate for undergraduate computing education](/projects/undergrad), I also publish pedagogical interventions that [integrate social responsibility into core computing curriculum](/projects/responsibleCS), and serve on the [Computer Research Association‚Äôs Education (CRA-E)](https://cra.org/crae/) Board of Directors.

Before CU, I was an Associate Professor of [Computer Science at Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/majors-departments/computer-science), I received my [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/) from Tufts University with [Robert Jacob](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/), and worked (during a recent sabbatical) as a Visiting Scientist at [MIT](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/) with [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com/).  

<!-- [Check out my student FAQ](/student-faq) if you have questions about meeting, about research, or about recommendation letters! -->

**Students:**  In Spring 2025, I will be teaching INFO 4602: Information Visualization. We will meet MWF at 10:10am in the Continuing Education Center.
