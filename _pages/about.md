I am an Associate Professor of [Information Science at University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience), Associate Chair for Undergraduate Studies, and director of the **[CU Information Visions Lab](https://infovisions.github.io/)** (_under construction!_).

- üìä [My research group focuses on the opportunities and barriers of public data communication](/projects/publicVis), believing that our engagement, trust, and understanding of data is a critical societal challenge. My work is situated within the fields of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-computer-interaction-brief-intro) and [Information Visualization](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/information-visualization). 
- üßë‚Äçüíª As [an advocate for undergraduate computing education](/projects/undergrad), I also publish pedagogical interventions that [integrate social responsibility into core computing curriculum](/projects/responsibleCS), and serve on the [Computer Research Association‚Äôs Education (CRA-E)](https://cra.org/crae/) Board of Directors. See my [teaching page](/teaching/) for a broader perspective on my educational involvement. 

Before CU, I was an Associate Professor of [Computer Science at Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/majors-departments/computer-science), I received my [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/) from Tufts University with [Robert Jacob](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/), and worked (during a recent sabbatical) as a Visiting Scientist at [MIT](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/) with [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com/).  

<!-- [Check out my student FAQ](/student-faq) if you have questions about meeting, about research, or about recommendation letters! -->

üì£  **Prospective Ph.D. Students:** I do _not_ plan on offering new funded positions in my lab for the Fall 2026 application cycle. I encourage you to look at [my wonderful colleagues](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience/labs) for other potential opportunities.
