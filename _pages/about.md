üì£  After 9 wonderful years at Bucknell, I moved to the **[Department of Information Science at CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience)**. Please be patient as I transition my website over to my new context. If you are thinking about graduate school, **I am planning to accept 1 or more PhD students for Fall 2024 - [click this link for more info](https://evanpeck.github.io/group/new-phd)** 
{: .notice--cu}

I am an Associate Professor of [Information Science at University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cmci/infoscience). My research draws on the fields of [Human-Computer Interaction](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/human-computer-interaction-brief-intro) and [Information Visualization](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/information-visualization). I believe that improving the public's engagement, trust, and understanding of data is a critical societal challenge. My research focuses on the opportunities and barriers of both data representations and data tools when they are embedded within our public sphere.

Before CU, I was an Associate Professor of [Computer Science at Bucknell University](https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/college-engineering/majors-departments/computer-science), I  received my [Ph.D. in Computer Science](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/) from Tufts University with [Robert Jacob](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~jacob/), and worked (during a recent sabbatical) as a Visiting Scientist at [MIT](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/) with [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com/).  

<!-- [Check out my student FAQ](/student-faq) if you have questions about meeting, about research, or about recommendation letters! -->

**Students:**  This semester, I am teaching [INFO 4602: Information Visualization](https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/95292). We will be meeting MWF at 10:00am in HUMN 1B90.
