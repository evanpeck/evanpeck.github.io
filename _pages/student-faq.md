## Student FAQ

**For Students:** I'm using this space to consolidate questions that I frequently answer for students.

### Can we meet? 
_Of course!_ One of the benefits of being at student at Bucknell is that you have access to your professors, even if you're not currently a student in my class. The best way to meet with me is to [use this link and propose meeting times](https://go.oncehub.com//EvanMPeck). If you can't seem to find any times that work for both of us, you should [email me anyways](mailto:evan.peck@bucknell.edu) to see if we can work something out. 


### Will you write me a recommendation letter?
I write recommendation letters for students every year. 

_Should I write you a letter?_ Obviously, the more that we've interacted, the more that I can write about you, and the stronger the letter may be. 

_What to do if I'm wring you a letter:_
- Give me _at least_ 2 weeks notice. 
- _Send me the material that you plan to send when you're applying._ This might be as simple as a resume or may include more detailed application materials. It's helpful for me to see how you frame yourself so I can reinforce and amplify the points you're making! Even if you have an early draft, it's helpful for me to see where you're headed with your application.  
- _Remind me of things you're proud about_. This isn't a time to be modest. 
- If you're comfortable doing so, _please share with me the other people who are writing you a letter_. Your letters tell a collective story about you, so I may change which parts I emphasize about you depending on the other people writing you letters. 
- _If you're applying to graduate schools_, please create a shared Google Sheet with me that lists (1) the places you're applying, (2) the deadline, and (3) if I should have received a recommendation-request email from them yet.
