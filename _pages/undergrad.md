- I am an advocate for primarily-undergraduate institutions (PUI). I manage [an email list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hciforpui) of HCI professors at PUIs, curate [a website for faculty CS positions at PUIs](https://cs-pui.github.io/), and [write](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/the-jobs-i-didnt-see-my-misconceptions-of-the-academic-job-market-9cb98b057422) about the [benefits of liberal arts colleges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8490181).
- I see research as a mechanism that should empowers students, and adhere to a [Student-Centered Research Manifesto](https://medium.com/bucknell-hci/a-student-centered-research-manifesto-bfb41072fdca). I [publish](http://www.bucknell.edu/news-and-media/current-news/2017/june/student-researchers-ask-how-secure-we-feel-about-internet-security.html) along undergraduate students (including a [Best Paper Award](https://twitter.com/EvanMPeck/status/1107677854970585088) at [ACM CHI](https://chi2019.acm.org/)!), and serve on the selection committee for [CRA\'s Oustanding Undergraduate Researchers award](https://cra.org/about/awards/outstanding-undergraduate-researcher-award/).s
