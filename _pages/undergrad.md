**!!!** This page is **heavily** under construction, so stick with me while I work on it. Until then, visit my current homepage at [http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/](http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~emp017/)

I am an advocate for primarily-undergraduate institutions (PUI) - both as environments that are positioned to confront society's most pressing sociotechnical problems, and also as institutions that offer a compelling balance of teaching and research for new faculty. I work to promote undergraduate research processes and products within my scholarly community, and see undergrad researchers as a critical (but often overlooked) group within academia.
