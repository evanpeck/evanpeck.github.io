## Empowering People through Data


**I believe that improving the public's trust and understanding of data is a critical societal challenge.** My research focuses on how data representation and data tools can improve our engagement with data in the public sphere. I am particularly interested in the ways that poor assumptions about where people live, their access to technology, and their experiences undermine the impact the way we see and use data. My hope is that we can reimagine the processes and mechanisms we use to share data with more diverse communities. 

My current work is amplified by wonderful collaborations with [Arvind Satyanarayan](https://arvindsatya.com/) at [MIT's Visualization Group](http://vis.csail.mit.edu/) (where I was a _Visiting Scientist_ during the '21/'22 academic year), [Lane Harrison](https://web.cs.wpi.edu/~ltharrison/) at Worceser Polytechnic Institute, and [Narges Mahyar](https://groups.cs.umass.edu/nmahyar) at UMass Amherst. At Bucknell, my research prioritizes [collaboration with undergraduate students](/undergrad/).
