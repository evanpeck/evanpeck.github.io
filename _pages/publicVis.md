**I believe that improving the public's engagement, trust, and understanding of data is a critical challenge for the 21st century.** My research focuses on the opportunities and barriers of both data representation and data tools when they are embedded within our public sphere. 

I am especially interested in the ways our bad assumptions about people (about where they live, their technology, their experiences, their values, etc.) fundamentally undermine the impact of our data. My hope is that we can reimagine the processes and mechanisms we use to share data with more diverse communities.
