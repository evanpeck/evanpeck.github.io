In this paper, we explore which factors may drive attention and trust in rural groups with diverse economic and educational backgrounds. In 42 semistructured interviews in rural Pennsylvania (USA), we find that a complex set of factors inform attitudes and perceptions about data visualization - including educational background, political affiliation, and personal experience",
